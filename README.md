# Aetherglass

## Overview

Aetherglass is a 2D action-platformer built around **fast-paced procedural arenas** and deep magic mechanics.
Players jump straight into challenging encounters, casting and combining custom spells to survive dynamic arenas filled with hazards and powerful enemies. The focus is on **risk-reward gameplay, spell mastery, and skill-based combat**, with no filler weak enemies.

## Features

* **HP & Mana Hybrid:** First 80% of health also acts as mana; the last 20% is pure HP.
* **Custom Spell System:** Modular spells let players mix elements, modifiers, and effects to tackle arenas creatively.
* **Procedural Arenas:** Levels and enemy combinations are generated on the fly, providing endless variety and replayability.
* **Skill-Driven Combat:** Every encounter challenges precision, timing, and smart spell use.
* **Dynamic Interactions:** Magic affects the environment and enemies (e.g., Fire + Water → Steam).
* **Ultra-Light:** Optimized to run smoothly even on low-end hardware.
